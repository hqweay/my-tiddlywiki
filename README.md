This repository configured :

* travis : build your [wiki].html file automatically, push it to gh-pages branch. supported by [https://travis-ci.com/](https://travis-ci.com/) .
* plugin-markdown-it : use markdown-it to render your .md tiddlers.
* contributionBanner : add a Banner of 'edit it on Github' when user try to edit tiddlers.
* table of contents : use 'table of contents' to organize tiddlers.

I think TiddlyWiki has a lack of support for markdown, I don't find a solution to add toc for my .md tiddlers...But .tid files works well...

Maybe I should try .tid, but that's bad if I want to transfer all my notes to TiddlyWiki, so I gave up...

Thanks for [miRoox/wiki](https://github.com/miRoox/wiki)
